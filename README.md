###Description
Goal of this repo is to share/collect customer created/customized Visulization for Microstrategy dashboards. Microstrategy provides several OOTB Visulization in our platform, but it may not be enough. Visulization in Micrstratey platform is based on JavaScript, so it is possible to create or adjust exist visulization to fit in Microstrategy platform. Some great work such as [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) makes it even more convenient.
